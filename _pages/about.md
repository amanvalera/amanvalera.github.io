Hi, I'm Aman Valera. I hold a Master‚Äôs in Data Science from Heriot-Watt University and have experience in building data pipelines, dashboards, and machine learning models to solve practical problems. I have a growing interest in cricket analytics and how structured data can offer new perspectives on the game.

To support myself and repay my educational loan, I currently work hourly at Pizza Hut while staying focused on projects, volunteering, and deepening my expertise. I‚Äôve presented my work at university, contributed to charities through dashboard design, and aim to build solutions that are autonomous and genuinely useful.
