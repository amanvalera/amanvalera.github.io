I'm a data scientist with a Master‚Äôs from Heriot-Watt University and over two years of experience in business intelligence and predictive modeling. I‚Äôve built real-time machine learning models to forecast IPL match outcomes with up to 84% F1 score, using over 15 years of ball-by-ball data. My work combines domain expertise in cricket with advanced statistical techniques and end-to-end deployment on platforms like Streamlit and AWS. I'm now developing a next-gen cricket analytics platform focused on real-time intelligence for betting and performance ‚Äî and I‚Äôm looking to connect with others passionate about pushing the boundaries of sports data.
