I’m a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with expertise in **sports analytics** and **business intelligence**.  

### What I Do
- **Business Intelligence**: Dashboards, SQL pipelines, and reporting systems (Power BI, Looker Studio).  
- **Predictive Analytics**: End-to-end ML solutions for forecasting, strategy, and sports (e.g., IPL win prediction).  
- **Frontier AI Research**: Exploring deep learning, agent-based AI, and biologically inspired computation.  

### Impact
Delivered **end-to-end systems** that connect raw data to business impact — from SQL pipelines to predictive ML models, including an **84% F1 score** in live IPL match predictions.  

### Focus
- **Practical impact today** → analytics pipelines, dashboards, and models that drive business decisions.  
- **Exploring tomorrow** → research in agent-based systems, biologically inspired computation, and advanced statistical modeling.
