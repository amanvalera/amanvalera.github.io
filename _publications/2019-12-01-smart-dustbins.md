This work presents an IoT-based dustbin system capable of:
- Automatic wet/dry waste segregation using moisture sensors  
- Real-time monitoring and bin-status tracking  
- Optimized waste collection routes through Android apps  
- Data-driven reporting for municipalities  

The system demonstrates how smart cities can achieve efficiency in waste collection and sustainability.
